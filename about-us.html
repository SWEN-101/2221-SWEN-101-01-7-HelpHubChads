                <h2>About Us</h2>
            </div>
            <p>We have observed that many people within communities around the world have a burning desire to help the members 
                of their community, but oftentimes they do not have the time or the energy to seek out such opportunities. 
                We have come up with a new app to fix this issue, HelpHub. HelpHub is created to encourage people to engage in 
                their community and help each other.</p>
            <p>HelpHub will revolutionize the way advertising for local volunteering is approached. Everyone can use HelpHub, 
                from citizens to churches, to Boy Scouts, and even businesses. We envision two types of people who will use this app: 
                the volunteers and the organizers. Volunteers can use the app to find events in the area to volunteer for using 
                various search filters, and the organizers set up these events with useful information, such as time, date, 
                description of the event, name, and location.</p>
